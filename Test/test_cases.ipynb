The structure, logic, and even variable names are closely resembling those in the similar code chunks. While the exact functionality might differ slightly, the core implementation and patterns are highly similar. The query code seems to be a modified version of the similar code chunks, with changes like input type (String vs int), loop conditions, and minor adjustments. The reverse function in the query code is similar to the reverse function in chunk [5]. The main method structure and input handling resemble chunks [2] and [3]. The confidence level of plagiarism detection is high due to the consistent patterns and similarities observed.\",\n",

Both codes calculate the BMI based on weight, feet, and inches input, and then classify the BMI into categories like underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. The structure, variable names, and logic are almost identical between the query code and code chunk [1]. The only differences are minor, such as the class name, import statement, and some formatting. Considering the high similarity score of 0.99 and the substantial overlap in functionality and structure, it is highly likely that the query code is plagiarized from code chunk [1].\",\n",
